== Q: How to open document from external file manager? ==
== A: ==
EbookDroid uses MIME types to handle different file types. Unfortunately, Android and lot of file managers might not support all MIME types. When this happens, you will not be able to open said files directly form the file manager. Some file managers allow you to add new MIME types and associate it with the corresponding file extension. Refer to your file manager manual or use internal file manager. All MIME types supported by EBookDroid are listed [MimeTypes here].
